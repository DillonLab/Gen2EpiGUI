About Gen2Epi Version 1.0

Gen2Epi is a computational Whole Genome Sequencing analysis pipeline to assemble short reads into full genomes and link the assembled sequences to strain typing and AMR determinant information automatically. 
The requirements for running Gen2Epi on a computer with a 3.6GHz CPU is as following:

	1) VirtualBox 5.2.14 or higher (works well with latest release 5.6)
	2) Hard disk storage = 29 GB
	3) RAM = 2 GB
	4) Processor = 2
